## Week 1 & 2: Core Web & JS Basics 

### Flex box;

          Flexbox is a way to arrage items into rows and columns. This items will flex (either grow or shrink) based on the certain rules we define. 


#### display: flex;

This turn the box into a flex box. By default the elements in then flex box will be align rowise. 

### jutify-content: (flex-start, flex-end, center)

It works around the main axis. flex-start: will align the content from the start of the axis. flex-end will align the content to the end of the axis and center will align content in the center. 

It has additional complex arrangements like Space-between, Space-around, Space-evenly. This helps to play with the space between the content.

### align-items:(center, end, start,...)

It worls around the cross axis. It helps to place content at the center or end or start of the div (box). Ever row has its own axis. 

### align-content:

This will align all the content according to a central axis. This will help to arrange all the items evenly. 

### flex-direction: (row, column)

It helps to set the content in rowise or column wise manner. 

### gap: 10px; 

It helps to set some gap between the content. 

### flex-wrap: 

It will wrap the elements to the next line if flex-wrap: wrap is selected. 

### flex-grow

Allows getting bigger

### flex-shrink 

Allows getting smaller

### Grid 

        Grid is another CSS property which can be used to format the page layout to keep the website
responsive

### grid-template-column: (column1 column2 column3 .. column12)

We can use different types of grid tempplate setting like each column width in pixels or percentage or even fraction (1fr or 4fr). 

-- minmax(#min-width, #max-width), in this case the container will keep growing when the page size grows and shrink to the min-width

-- repeat(3, #width). This will help us to create 3 container of size width

### grid-start, grid-end:

This sets the start of the grid and end of the grid

1. Easier to read / scan the HTML
2. Better for SEO
3. Better for screen readers / accessibility
